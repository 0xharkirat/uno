# How to use Windows Community Toolkit

The [Windows Community Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/) is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer patterns when building experiences for Windows.

Depending on the version of the Windows Community Toolkit that you want to use, these tutorials below will walk you through adding and implementing:

- **[For WCT version 8.x](xref:Uno.Development.CommunityToolkit.v8):** The `SettingsCard` control, but the same steps can be followed for any of the Windows Community Toolkit components supported out of the box.
- **[For WCT version 7.x](xref:Uno.Development.CommunityToolkit.v7):** The `DataGrid` control, but the same steps can be followed for any of the Uno ported Windows Community Toolkit components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Here is the [Migration Guide from v7 to v8 for Windows Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Windows/wiki/Migration-Guide-from-v7-to-v8) for additional information on what changed lately between these versions.**
>
> For some controls (`DataGrid`, `Carousel`, ect...) you will need to use **version 7.x** for them as they are no longer available in the latest 8.x version of Windows Community Toolkit. The complete list of changes is available in the [migration guide](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Windows/wiki/Migration-Guide-from-v7-to-v8).
