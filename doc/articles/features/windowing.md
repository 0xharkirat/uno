## Explaining basic Windowing APIs

There are several "window" types in Uno Platform apps, some are legacy only and will be removed in future releases.

- `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window` - the main type representing a XAML-based Window. Allows for basic manipulation and setting content.
- `Microsoft.UI.Windowing.AppWindow` - represents a general Window (may not be XAML based). Includes advanced capabilities not present on `Window` itself.

The legacy types are:


## Displaying the initial window of your application

Most commonly 

## Custom Window type

## Displaying multiple windows
