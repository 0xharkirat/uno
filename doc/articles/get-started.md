# Get Started

Welcome to Uno Platform! You'll be creating cross-platform applications with XAML and C# in no time.

To set up your development environment, first select the operating system you're developing on.

**I am developing with...**

 - [Windows](#windows)
 - [macOS](#macos)
 - [Linux](#linux)

 ## Windows

If you're developing on Windows, we recommend you use **Visual Studio**, for the richest XAML development experience and broadest platform coverage. 

If you already use and love **JetBrains Rider** or **Visual Studio Code**, you can also use them to develop Uno Platform applications. Check the support matrix below to see which target platforms they support.

**Choose the IDE you want to use:**

 - [Get started with Visual Studio for Windows](get-started-vs.md)
 - [Get started with VS Code](get-started-vscode.md)
 - [Get started with Rider](get-started-rider.md)
