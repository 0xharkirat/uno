# Issues related to all development environments

## Could not resolve SDK "Uno.Sdk"

This error may happen for multiple reasons:

- Ensure that all [NuGet feeds are authenticated properly](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/consuming-packages-authenticated-feeds). When building on the command line, some enterprise NuGet feeds may not be authenticated properly.
- Ensure that no global package mappings are interfering with nuget restore. To validate that no package mappings are set, on Windows for Visual Studio 2022:
  - Make a backup copy of `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.Config`
  - Open a visual studio instance that does not have any solution opened
  - Go to **Tools**, **Options**, **NuGet Package Manager**, then **Package Source Mappings**
  - If there are entries in the list, click then click **Remove All**

Try building your project again.

## Runtime error `No parameterless constructor defined for XXXX`

This error is generally caused by some missing [IL Linker](https://github.com/mono/linker/tree/master/docs) configuration on WebAssembly. You may need to add some of your application assemblies in the LinkerConfig.xml file of your project. You can find [additional information in the documentation](features/using-il-linker-webassembly.md).

Similar error messages using various libraries:

- `Don't know how to detect when XXX is activated/deactivated, you may need to implement IActivationForViewFetcher` (ReactiveUI)

## Cannot build with both Uno.WinUI and Uno.UI NuGet packages referenced

This issue generally happens when referencing an Uno.UI (using UWP APIs) NuGet package in an application that uses Uno.WinUI (Using WinAppSDK APIs).

For instance, if your application has `<PackageReference Include="Uno.WinUI"` in the `csproj` files, this means that you'll need to reference WinUI versions of NuGet packages.

For instance:

- `Uno.UI` -> `Uno.WinUI`

## Abnormally long build times when using Roslyn analyzers

It is a good practice to use Roslyn analyzers to validate your code during compilation, but some generators may have difficulty handling the source generated by the Uno Platform (one notable example is [GCop](https://github.com/Geeksltd/GCop)). You may need to disable those for Uno projects or get an update from the analyzer's vendor.
