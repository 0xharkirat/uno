If you're a more experienced developer, you may want to skip this tutorial and jump straight to either the [SimpleCalculator](xref:Workshop.SimpleCalc.Overview) or the [TubePlayer](xref:Workshop.TubePlayer.Overview) sample. Both are more complex and will give you a better idea of what Uno Platform can do.

## Create the Application

To get started, we're going to use the Uno Platform solution template with the simplest set of options selected. The solution template can be accessed using either Visual Studio's New Project wizard or the command line.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you don't have the `Uno Platform Extension for Visual Studio` installed, follow [these instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vs2022).

- Launch `Visual Studio` and click on `Create new project` on the Start Window. Alternatively, if you're already in Visual Studio, click `New, Project` from the `File` menu.

- Type `Uno Platform` in the search box

- Click `Uno Platform App`, then `Next`

- Name the project `Counter` and click `Create`

At this point you'll enter the `Uno Platform Template Wizard`, giving you options to customize the generated application. For this tutorial, we're only going to configure the markup language and the presentation framework.

- Select `Blank` and click `Customize`
